        This project investigates the concept of e-waste as a physical,
        digital, material, and processual phenomenon. It uses a broad definition of e-waste
        which includes obsolete electronics, appliances, and gadgets as well as dead apps and digital
        ephemera, such as old email invites, digital correspondences, and automated messages.
        
        <br><br>Key questions to consider include:
        <br><i>How do different communities think about waste creation or cycles? 
        <br>What does it mean to “throw away” something? Where is “away?” 
        <br>(How) can electronic waste be integrated effectively into waste remediation?
        <br>What kinds of digital ephemera do people retain? What do people discard? 
        <br>What is something you wouldn’t hesitate to delete? 
        <br>How is value derived in obsolete media?</i>
        
        <br><br> Thank you to everyone who contributed their e-waste to this project. Look and listen carefully, perhaps you can find it!
