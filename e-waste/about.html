        This project investigates the concept of e-waste as a physical,
        digital, material, and processual phenomenon. It uses a broad definition of e-waste
        which includes obsolete electronics, appliances, and gadgets as well as dead apps and digital
        ephemera, such as old email invites, digital correspondences, and automated messages.
        
        <br><br>I have been collecting digital ephemera in my E-waste Dump and creating textual-visual, audio, and video collages from the submissions in order to meditate on how waste has historically been conceptualized by different global communities, where waste goes, and how our current conceptions of waste defy the cycles of breakdown and renewal typically found in nature. 
        
        <br>I invite visitors to scroll through this work-in-progress. Check back soon for updates on interactive features :)

        <br><br>Key questions to consider include:
        <br><i>How is value derived in and from obsolete media? 
        <br>What stories do people tell about e-waste? How do these stories influence our affective relationships to waste?
        <br>What features of digital storytelling and poetics differentiate it from other forms of literature?
        <br>How does the process of digital text creation – whether the textual object was intentionally formed, what platforms were used, and how online communities remix and remake a text – inform audiences’ experiences?
        <br>How does interactivity and collaboration create meaning in digital texts?</i>
       
        <br><br> Thank you to everyone who contributed their e-waste to this project. Look and listen carefully, perhaps you can find it! And special thanks to the members of Professor Juan Llamas-Rodriguez's Publics, Forms, and Futures course at the Annenberg School for Communications, University of Pennsylvania, Spring 2025.
