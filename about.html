        I am a recent graduate of Columbia University, where I studied
        English and linguistics. During this time, I gained experience 
        writing in all genres, including playwriting, interactive 
        fiction, literary criticism, and more. My theatrical work has been 
        published by University of Pennsylvania's <i>La Vida</i> magazine, and 
        my critical essay "#RichKidsofTehran: Zoom Theatre, Remediation, and
        Interactivity" recieved Columbia University's Bunner Prize. I have also 
        spearheaded several marketing campaigns and creative projects, having worked for 
        Barnard's Pandemic Panels as well as led Columbia Int Fic, an interactive 
        fiction collective. In my spare time I can be found scrolling TikTok, 
        learning languages, or rollerskating.
