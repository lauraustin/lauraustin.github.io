        Hi  <span class="wave">👋🏾</span>  My name is Lauren Austin Alcindor and I'm on a journey to research, teach, and create New Media. I completed a B.A. in English with a special concentration in linguistics at Columbia University, where I also led an Interactive Fiction collective called Columbia Int Fic (CIF), wrote plays and short stories, and served as a dramaturg for campus theatre groups. My time at Columbia culminated in a Senior Essay, "#RichKidsofTehran: Zoom Theatre, Remediation, and Interactivity," which received the English Department's Bunner Award for best essay dealing with American Literature. Since graduating, I have worked in education access as well as spent a year abroad as part of the South Korea Fulbright program. 
        
        <br><br>Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in English at the University of Pennsylvania. Looking forward to where the next chapter takes me!
