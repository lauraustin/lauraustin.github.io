# How to Write an Essay 
**Created by Lauren Alcindor
**Project completed as part of Mark Sample's course Creative Coding in University of Pennsylvania's 2025 Dream Lab

This project is meant to serve as a helper for students learning basic essay formats. It offers tips on essay structure and users complete an entire essay outline by the end. Please note that it doesn't have a real saving mechanism (yet)! That means if you leave the page, your writing will be lost.

# e-waste

**Project and research for Professor Juan Llamas-Rodriguez's Publics, Forms, and Futures of Multimodal Scholarship course at the University of Pennsylvania**

This project is a work-in-progress!! Please don't pay it too much mind until it's revised more.
