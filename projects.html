        <p>An imaginative take on the mundane, <i>Head in the Clouds</i> illustrates how 
            imagination is not always the wonderland associated with childhood, but can also 
            be a source of anxiety as well as escapism. This piece is accompanied by 
            original music and images.

        <p><i>"I wonder if people are more like paper or plastic. When they are thrown away, 
            do they give in to the earth or struggle against it indefinitely?"</i> This piece,
        which takes place within Google Calendar, examines waste from a new perspective.

            Truong's <i>Book of Salt</i>. It utilizes a unique, dual-dialogue structure and 
            is accompanied by original images.</p>
