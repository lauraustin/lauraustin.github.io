         <h3><a href="https://lauraustin.github.io/e-waste" target="_blank">E-waste</a></h3>
        <p>In progress! This project explores e-waste, a physical, digital, and processual phenomenon encompassing digital ephemera, such as spam and old messages, in addition to physical artifacts, from obsolete phones to appliances. I have been collecting digital ephemera in my E-waste Dump and creating textual-visual, audio, and video collages from the submissions in order to meditate on how waste has historically been conceptualized by different global communities, where waste goes, and how our current conceptions of waste defy the cycles of breakdown and renewal typically found in nature. Check it out until something breaks :)

        <h3><a href="https://lauraustin.github.io/essay/how-to-write-an-essay.html" target="_blank">How to Write an Essay</a></h3>
        <p>This project is meant to serve as a helper for high school students learning basic essay formats. It offers tips on essay structure and users will have completed an entire essay outline by the end. Please note that it doesn't have a real saving mechanism (yet)! That means if you leave the page, your writing will be lost.

        <h3><a href="https://lauraustin.github.io/ULFinalProject/comenius.html" target="_blank">Comenius: A Timeline</a></h3>
        <p>A thinker, a bishop, and a universal language inventor. This interactive timeline tracks the life of an influential figure of the late 17th century, according to the timeline presented in Jean Piaget's 1993 article "Jan Amos Comenius."

        <h3><a href="https://lauraust.itch.io/head-in-the-clouds" target="_blank">Head in the Clouds</a></h3>
        <p>An imaginative take on the mundane, <i>Head in the Clouds</i> illustrates how 
            imagination is not always the wonderland associated with childhood, but can also 
            be a source of anxiety as well as escapism. This piece is accompanied by 
            original music and images.

        <h3><a href="https://lauraustin.github.io/Trash2020/trash2020twine.html" target="_blank">Trash 2020</a></h3>
        <p><i>"I wonder if people are more like paper or plastic. When they are thrown away, 
            do they give in to the earth or struggle against it indefinitely?"</i> This piece,
        which takes place within Google Calendar, examines waste from a new perspective.

        <h3><a href="https://lauraust.itch.io/the-salt-of-labor" target="_blank">The Salt of Labor</a></h3>
        <p>This collective project tells the day in the life of two characters from Monique 
            Truong's <i>Book of Salt</i>. It utilizes a unique, dual-dialogue structure and 
            is accompanied by original images.</p>
