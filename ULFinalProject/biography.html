        <b>John Amos Comenius</b> (1592-1670) was a Czech thinker whose own educational background heavily affected his outlook towards education and the capacity of all to learn.
        
        <br><br>He was born in Moravia and orphaned young in life. As a result, he only began his Latin education at sixteen years of age (Piaget 185). Comenius was interested in translation from the beginning of his studies. One of his great, lost works is a Latin-Czech glossary, which he worked on from his youth until well into his middle-age before the draft burned in the fire of Leszno (Piaget 189). In addition to his own early educational background, regional conflicts determined Comeniusâ€™s relationship to learning and caused him to deeply consider cross-religious and multilingual collaboration as a method of encouraging peace between disparate groups.
        
        <br><br>Comenius imagined a pedagogy and educational system which matched students' abilities to the correct level of task. He imagined a system which did not only rely on memorization without understanding (Piaget 176-177), but rather encouraged deduction and critical thinking. Most of all, Comenius had faith in "pansophia," a universal knowledge that was possessed by all, including women and people of different ethnic backgrounds. Several of his publications rely on the idea of different types of universal knowledge either in already existence or imagined. 
	
        <br><br>Comenius imagined universal language as a method of achieving world peace in his book <i>Panglottia</i>. He discusses using language as a tool to unite thought and avoid war through either raising all languages to a high level, pushing the adoption of a set of "polished" languages, or creating a new a priori philosophical language for all to adopt (Comenius 12). <i>Panglottia</i> heavily influenced later a priori philosophical languages, including the work of English philosopher John Wilkins (Eco 216).
        
        <br><br>Today, Comenius is best known for his influence on pedagogy and developmental psychology.
