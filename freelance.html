        <h3>Creative Consulting</h3>
        <p>
            I'd love to collaborate on your next creative project! I have worked in 
            a diverse array of capacities, including but not limited to narrative 
            ideation, video-editing, and dramaturgy, and I'm always open to hopping on
            innovative and experimental projects.
        </p>

        <h3>Writing & Editing</h3>
        <p>Need help writing content, a second pair of eyes for an essay, or feedback
            on creative work? My experience in copywriting, professional essay 
            evaluation, script-editing and more prepares me for whatever writing needs
            you may have.
        </p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>
            Webpages, blogs, or even portfolio pages (like this one!) are all things
            I can guide you through. My work creating the webpages for 
            Barnard Pandemic Panels, collaborating on the first iteration of CIF's 
            homepage, as well as numerous works of hypertext fiction gives me 
            experience with HTML, CSS, JS, and Twine.  
        </p>

        <h3>Academic Advising</h3>
        <p> 
            Do you require academic tutoring, language exchange, or general guidance?
            I've worked with students of all ages in subjects such as 
            English, philosophy, and college prep, and am happy to assist learners at 
            any stage.
